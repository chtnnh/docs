## Welcome to the PDF Vision API

The PDF Vision API enables the extraction of structured data from PDF documents using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The API processes PDF files through a multi-step pipeline:

1. Converting PDF pages to images
2. Analyzing each image using the Vision API
3. Extracting data based on a user-defined JSON schema
4. Consolidating results across all pages
